  <h1>Matchbox Car Replication - 3D Printing </h!>
    <p><i>This is what my project is all about! </i></p>

    <h3> Here's a little bit about  the project :</h3>
    <p> This was our first project in Honors Engineering and Design that involved 3D models and #D printing.  In order to produce accurate models, extremely precise measurements need to be taken to achieve optimal scaling.  This was the most critical part of the project, as in previous ones, measurements didn't need to be so exact.  After the intial design phase, the 3D Matchbox Car Replication traced the process and iterations of producing a 3D model, which is unlike anything we've done to date. </p>



    <h3> Project Steps:</h3>
    <p>
      <li>Get exact measurements for the maximum length, width, and height of the car with callipers. </li>
      <li>Transfer these measurements into a drawing that would be copied into the onshape 3D design platform. </li>
      <li>Create a 3D car out of a 2D drawing.  This step required multiple iterations inside of onshape in order to make sure the car had sufficient detail.  </li>
      <li>Once the fillets and wheels were implemented into the 3D design, the file could be exported as a stl file, and uploaded into Ultimaker CURA, where it was formatted into the correct format (gcode) for the printer. </li>
      <li>In the meantime, while printing, a CAD drawing was made virtually via onshape, and inaccuracies between the 3D car and actual car were compared and calculated. </li>
      <li>The final step of the project was to make this website as a way of reflecting on the project. </li>
</p>


      <h3> The Design Process:</h3>

        <p> The design process was different in this project, as we modelled our cars off of pre-existing cars, and there weren't supposed to be an elements added, as it wouldn't be a model if elements were added.  The design process considted of drawing the original car in 2D, and shaping the car off of the drawing in 3D, as well as adding certain curves and elements through fillets. </p>

        <h3> GitHub archive:</h3>

          <p> After completing my design, I uploaded each iteration and the final design on GitHub. You can find the repository for this project here: https://github.com/maxmeissner/ED1/tree/master/Car </p>



            <h3> Fabrication: </h3>
<p>The 3D cutter cannot print a stl file file so I converted the file into a gcode in Ultimater Cura before moving to the printer.
 </p>

        <h3> Challenges, setbacks, and solutions:</h3>

          <p> The main challenges in the 3D Design project stemmed from inaccuracies in inital measurements and intiricate car elements.  Since I did not measure the angle of elevation of the back hood of the car, the slant was quite off in the final 3D model.  Looking back, I should've payed closer attention to the angles in the design in order to make it as realistic as possible.  The other problem I faced in this project was implementing the complex details of the matchbox car into my car: something I found very difficult.  There were many rivets and grooves in the car that didn't end up making it into my 3D model, making it an inaccurate model, unfortunately.  This was definitely the biggest setback, but I worked hard to make the shape and dimensions of my model, which is what we measured for, as accurate as possible.  The final difficulty I face was formatting the images properly into my design.  At first, they were too large inside of the website, but with some reasearch, I figured out how to make the image the correct size.  Unfortunately, some image quality was comprimised, but I am glad the formatting worked out.</p>
